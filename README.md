genprog: Genetic programming library
====================================

This package provides a *genetic programming* framework. Genetic programming is
an evolutionary technique, inspired by biological evolution, to evolve programs
for solving specific problems. A genetic program is represented by a value of
an algebraic datatype and associated with a custom-defined *fitness* value
indicating the quality of the solution. Starting from a randomly generated
initial population of genetic programs, the genetic operators of *selection*,
*crossover*, and *mutation* are used to evolve programs of increasingly better
quality.
