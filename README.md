genprog: Genetic programming library
====================================

This package provides a /genetic programming/ framework. Genetic programming is
an evolutionary technique, inspired by biological evolution, to evolve programs
for solving specific problems. A genetic program is represented by a value of
an algebraic datatype and associated with a custom-defined /fitness/ value
indicating the quality of the solution. Starting from a randomly generated
initial population of genetic programs, the genetic operators of /selection/,
/crossover/, and /mutation/ are used to evolve programs of increasingly better
quality.

Documentation and examples are available [here](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/genprog/0.1/doc/html/GenProg.html).
